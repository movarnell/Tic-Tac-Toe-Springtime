LOGIC
Just need to remove event listener upon game win conditions being met.  Tried a few things but they affected other program features.  Shouldn't take too long.

Could add date feature so that the screen defaults to current season.


STYLING
Change up color scheme to match a bit more.

Add hover effect that makes a shadow of the x or o when user mouses over cell.

Add animation - upon win - pretty vine draws the line accross winning track.  Butterfly wings flapping?  Flowers growing up from the bottom?  Bunny jumping? :)
